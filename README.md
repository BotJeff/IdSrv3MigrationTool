# Identity Server 3 Data Migration Tool

IdentityServer is a .NET/Katana-based framework and hostable component that allows implementing single sign-on and access control for modern web applications and APIs using protocols like OpenID Connect and OAuth2. It supports a wide range of clients like mobile, web, SPAs and desktop applications and is extensible to allow integration in new and existing architectures.

This tool aims to provide an example of how to migrate an Identity Server 2 database implementation to an Identity Server 3 database with an Identity Manager and BrockAllen MembershipReboot implementation.

Please bear in mind, this is meant as an example and not plug and play as database implementations can vary. Enjoy.
